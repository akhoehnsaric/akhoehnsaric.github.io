The content of your blog post goes here.
Write a post on a visualization technique of your choice (line plot, histogram, heat-map, etc). How is it being used to answer analytical problems and what are itâ€™s strengths and weaknesses?


When a interior designer works on a project, the project goes through many design critque (design crits) before it is finally approved to be sent out to create construction documents, which are the documents used to build a building. Before technology had such a big presence in the design world, a crit would occur in person with either the client or a creative director where it would be reviewed in real time with the design team infront of the critic so there was no waiting period to hear about comments and a designer can immediately continue making changes. 

Now a days though, these crits are happening online. This online process usually works by a designer will submit a package for review to an online portal. A critic will open the package up at any time, which means that there is a good chance that the critic will not look at it immediately.  This also means that a critic can spend as much time as they want (within limit) reviewing a design package. This slows down the design process and can drastically effect the timeline of a buildings opening. 

This is where data can really play in hand of a designer. We can extrapulate data from this online portal and see when a designer submits a design package and then when a package is approved by a critique. 

In an example of a design company that works within regions with one creative director to critique all of the region's design packages, we can study on average how long it takes for the critic to review pacakges per region with a bar chart. With a bar chart the x line would store each region while the y line would store amount of days. This is beneficial for a region to see how long it takes on average for their region to get approved and compare with other regions. The weakness lies in the fact all the data would be averages. Theses averages don't speak to all projects and though one region might have an approval rate of 3 days but could have one project could take 9 days for approval and other one a few hours which could cause frustration for the designer and also create inaccurate data. 

A better way to get more accurate data of each regions approval rate would be to create a box and whiskers plot. This way one could see averages and also see skewed data points that could effect timelines.
