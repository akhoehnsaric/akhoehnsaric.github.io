For me data has always been a part of who I am without truly realizing it until wanting to take this Flatiron Data Science course.

I am an Interior Designer by study, however I was never very good at the aesthetics of it all. I was more interested in the process and the tools that went into making the design process easier. In college I was always looking at the more mathematical side of design focusing on computational design.

This lead me to an internship with a company called Proving Ground, which was my first true work with any data. While there, I worked on a tool, now known as Minecart, that enables design firms to transfer building information into big data to study trends in the market and manage building assets. Building information modeling is the central component to building design and delivery, however, once a building is complete this information is archived and never looked back on. Designers must take these models and study them to inform design decisions for the future. It is a little stupid to say, but at the time I did not realize that this was what a data scientist did at all, I associated this more with a design technologist (bim specialist) . I never associated the fact that a data scientist could be interested in studying design and vice versa. Amazingly this internship gave me the opportunity to work for The We Company. 

I have been working at Wework (now The We Company) for 11 months now. During this time, I spent the first 5-6 months working with and observing interior designers in a specific region. During this time I was able to find the pin-points of the process and really understand how not just one designer works but about 12 different designers work. Now I am working at a global level for Interior designers working on ways to improve the process through technology. Looking at design from an individual level to global level really made realize how different everyone works just slightly and how there is no one at this point tracking what an interior designer does. No one is looking at preliminary budgets vs actual budgets for interior designers, no one is studying material, furniture, or design trends. We are not able to make smarter and better design decisions without this data. That is why I started taking this data science course, because I want to be able to inform designers and give designers tools to improve efficiencies but to do so we must be able to have data to back our decisions.
